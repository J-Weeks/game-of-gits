House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to
being, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!

Oh ya he will you will see! He went to drink his wine and was killed by a
princess on a dragon!

And then Jason appeared and he was awesome! Unlike me :(

You're not that bad dude. You just can't hold your sushi.
