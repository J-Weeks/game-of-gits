House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Eddard, after defeating the evil boy-king Joffrey with his wisdom and cunning,
became not only Lord of Winterfell but also Lord of the Entire Realm of
Westeros.
